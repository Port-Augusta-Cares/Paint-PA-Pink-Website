## Settings in the [build] context are global and are applied to all contexts unless otherwise overridden by more specific contexts.

  # NOTE: This is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc, not repo root

  # the directory to publish (relative to root of your repo)

## Production context: All deploys from the Production branch set in your site's deploy settings will inherit these settings.
## production - this is the branch that was set in the UI to publish from

## Branch Deploy context: All deploys that are not resulting from a Pull/Merge Request and not from the primary, linked branch will inherit these settings.
